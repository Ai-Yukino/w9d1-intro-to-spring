# Grading

# Add in Styling (through a CSS Sheet)

`style.css` in `resources/static`

# Connect multiple pages

`index.html` -> `tea` and `console`  
`tea` -> (on submit) `teaResult`  
`teaResult` -> `index.html` and `console`

# Add images to your web pages

`index.html`

# Investigate HTML Forms & add a form

`tea` and `teaResult` in `resources/templates`
